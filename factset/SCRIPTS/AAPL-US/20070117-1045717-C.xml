          <p>Welcome to this Apple First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And now at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he will be joined by Apple's COO, Tim Cook; and Apple Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&amp;A session with analysts.</p>
          <p>Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, future products, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. And for more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2006 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report stellar financial results and another record-breaking quarter for Apple. The quarter's revenue was 7.12 billion, representing 24% growth over the prior December quarter's record results, which included a 14th week. The revenue growth was driven by very strong iPod sales during the holiday season and continued robust demand for Macs. Operating margin for the quarter was exceptionally high at 18.6% resulting from the revenue growth and effective cost management. We are particularly proud to have generated net income of $1 billion, which is up 78% over last year's record December quarter results and translated to earnings per share of $1.14.</p>
          <p>I would like to first talk about our Mac products and services, which represented 43% of our total quarterly revenue. We shipped a total of 1.61 million Macs, consistent with the record-setting shipment in our September back-to-school quarter and representing 28% growth over the 14-week year-ago quarter. We were very pleased with this growth, which was ahead of our expectations and represented about three times IDC's latest published market growth rate estimate for the December quarter. Ending channel inventory of Mac was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and was just below our target range of 4 to 5 weeks. We refreshed both the MacBook and MacBook Pro with Intel Core 2 Duo processors during the quarter and customer demand for our portable Macs remained particularly strong.</p>
          <p>Portable Mac shipments during the quarter grew 65% year-over-year and accounted for 60% of total Macs sold. It was an outstanding quarter for our music products and services. They accounted for 57% of total revenue during the quarter versus 59% in the year-ago quarter. We sold 21.1 million iPods, representing 50% growth over the year-ago quarter. The new iPod Shuffle began shipping at the end of October and we were very pleased with the demand for all three of our iPod product lines during the quarter. Channel inventory of iPods increased by about 200,000 units, all related to channel fill for the iPod Shuffle. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks on a look-forward basis.</p>
          <p>We are happy that iPod maintained its leadership position in the US in the face of increased competition. Our share of the US market for MP3 players was 72% in the month of December according to NPD Techworld. iPod shipments grew even faster in international markets, which resulted in share gains in every country for which we have market data. This gives us confidence that our emphasis on advertising, channel development, and improved supply in these markets has been effective.</p>
          <p>Other music revenue grew 29% year-over-year, fueled by very strong sales through the iTunes store. The store's growing content offering now includes over 4 million songs, 350 television shows, and 250 movies. As we announced last week, we have now sold over 2 billion songs and have added feature films from Paramount Pictures to our movie library. iTunes continues to lead the market for songs purchased and downloaded, accounting for over 85% of the US market based on the latest data from Nielsen SoundScan. iTunes gift cards were immensely popular during the holiday quarter and doubled year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Sales from our Apple retail stores were over 1.1 billion, the highest level in the stores' history. The stores generated 89 million of segment margin, not including 232 million of associated manufacturing profit. We opened five new stores during the quarter to end with 170 stores. With an average of 169 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was 6.7 million. The stores sold 308,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 60% year-over-year growth. Almost 28 million people visited our stores during the quarter, representing 13,000 customers per store per week. We continue to invest in our stores to support customers and to showcase our products. The stores are a wonderful place to buy Macs today, and we think they will provide customers a great experience with iPhone beginning in June.</p>
          <p>Gross margin was 31.2%, almost 300 basis points higher than our guidance, primarily due to the favorable commodity pricing environment, better product mix, and greater leverage of fixed cost due to the higher-than-expected revenue. Operating expenses were 898 million, including 40 million in expense related to stock-based compensation.</p>
          <p>OI&amp;E was 126 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 31%, slightly below our guidance of 32% due to the extension of the R&amp;D tax credit associated with recent legislation. We expect the tax rate to be 32% for the remaining quarters of the fiscal year. We had very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by over 1.75 billion to end with $11.9 billion. This was primarily a function of strong earnings and working capital management.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the March quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of between 4.8 and 4.9 billion. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately $66 million. We expect gross margin to be about 29.5%, reflecting approximately 8 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about 845 million, including about 58 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&amp;E to be about 130 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%. We expect to generate EPS of about $0.54 to $0.56, including an anticipated $0.05 per share related to non-cash share-based compensation expense.</p>
          <p>In closing, fiscal year 2007 is off to a tremendous start. We are incredibly proud to have just completed the first quarter with revenue of over 7 billion and net income of 1 billion. Last week at Macworld, we introduced the revolutionary iPhone and Apple TV, and we are very excited about the remarkable new products coming from Apple this year.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you do have any questions or comments, please press star one on your touchtone telephone. If you are joining us today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, star one for questions, and we will pause for just one moment.</p>
          <p>And we go first today to Mr. Ben Reitzes with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Peter, in your guidance, what are you factoring in, or are you factoring anything in for any pause in demand ahead of the iPhone, perhaps in the iPod markets or anything? And also what are you factoring in for seasonality in the iPod market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We factored our view of customer demand and supply into our guidance. And we, as you said, we just announced the iPhone last week and it's really too soon to tell, but we believe we've got a great iPod product offering today with a range of prices, capacities, and form factors to meet many customers' needs and uses, and we may be in a position to share some observations with you next quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of seasonality from the December to the March quarter, let me speak first about iPods and then I'll make some comments about Mac.</p>
          <p>For iPods, now in terms of assessing the MP3 market seasonality, we have learned over the last few years, that what really drives the MP3 market to new levels is innovative product launches and holiday season buying in the December quarter. iPod demand this quarter was extraordinary. We were able to ship over 21 million units, and unlike the previous year, iPod supply and demand were largely in balance. Given this, we would expect a higher seasonal decline from the December quarter to the March quarter this year than we saw last.</p>
          <p>For Macs, Apple does a significant percentage of its December quarter in the consumer segment and sequentially we would expect to see the holiday buying season drop off and the education buying to begin to ramp up in the spring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. One last thing is just with regard to your stock-option investigation, just any commentary that &#x2013; have you received any commentary from the SEC or Justice Department and are they happy with your findings or what do you expect to hear from them now or if anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look Ben, we have, from the beginning have voluntarily and proactively provided all details of our internal review and the independent investigation to the SEC and the US attorney for the northern district of California. The exhaustive and independent investigation found no misconduct by any member of Apple's current management team, and the Board has expressed complete confidence in the management team.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so, they still have no formal investigation and whatnot, and no comments from them, or else you'd have to share them, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are continuing to voluntarily and proactively inform them of our findings and answer their questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks Peter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hey Peter, you mentioned a very favorable commodity environment when you did your gross margin discussion. Could you talk about which commodities in particular were more favorable than expected in the quarter and could you give &#x2013; attempt please your typical supply-demand outlook for the March quarter as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure Rich; this is Tim. Last quarter we saw favorable pricing across the board. It was a great time to be a buyer. For this quarter, we see that favorable pricing environment continuing on LCDs and flash memory, and we believe that DRAM will be relatively supply-demand balanced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Rich. Could we have the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next now to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. I have two questions. The stores revenue collectively was up only 6%, despite the fact that CPU growth was up 60, and revenue was likely up 70 implying a dramatic deceleration year-over-year in iPod unit shipments in the stores. Can you comment on why that happened? What we've been seeing pretty well through history is the stores have always grown faster than Apple overall. I think other than the Intel transition this was the only time in history where that has not occurred; it clearly seems attributable to the iPod. Can you take me through why that might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Toni, now it's Peter. The retail store revenue, as you said, grew 6% year-over-year as total Mac sales increased by 60%. This was partially offset by lower iPod revenue, which resulted from the price reductions that we took in September, and also our expanded and well-supplied distribution channel that we had this year. And that was really the cause of it. We were very pleased with the stores' performance. They are bringing many new customers to Apple, and we think come June they'll sell a lot of iPhones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then secondly, just to clarify your channel inventory comments. I'm having trouble reconciling them. At the end of last quarter, you said iPod inventory &#x2013; I gather on a consistent look forward basis &#x2013; was in your range of 4 to 6 weeks. You're basically guiding for iPod revenues to be down more than 40% &#x2013; units to be down more than 40% sequentially. So, if your units are going to effectively be half, your inventory actually went up on a sequential basis in number of units, you were between 4 and 6. How is it possible that you are not at least 8 weeks of channel inventory at the end of this quarter on a look forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Toni, it's Tim. The difference between the beginning on hand and the ending on hand last quarter in the iPod space is only 200,000 units. So, it's a very, very small increase and all of that was due to the Shuffle, which did not start shipping until October. And, so because we think demand will be higher than in Q4, which is the previous four to six week period, we are still within four to six on a look forward basis in the January quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can you run that by me again. At the end of fiscal Q4, I thought on a look forward basis you were four to six weeks on what will be double the volume. So, if at the end of Q1 on a look forward basis you're still four to six weeks and your volumes looking forward are going to be half, yet your inventory went up, notionally, how is that possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The four to six weeks that you are quoting in Q4 was looking back. It was a backwards-looking looking four to six weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, if you look at &#x2013; if we did a look back basis on Q1, Toni, it would be one to two weeks. It would be a very, very small level of inventory. But that &#x2013; but that's an unrealistic number because we have inventory for forward &#x2013; forward sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will go next now to Richard Farmer at Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Peter and Tim. I would like to ask about the operating leverage and the margins in the quarter. The operating margin was 18.6%, a lot higher than most of us were modeling, gross margins as well &#x2013; 31%, higher than expected. I guess the question is how sustainable do you think that kind of operating leverage is? I heard the comments about the commodity environment and the leverage of the fixed expense, but is it reasonable to think that margins can go higher from here with more growth, or are you planning to make decisions to reinvest more aggressively in pricing for other things in a way that would reduce those margins more than a normalized amount seasonally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, I'll start and Tim may want to add a few comments. We were thrilled with the operating margin in the quarter, it is 18.6%, but as I said in my prepared remarks it was exceptionally high, driven by gross margin of 31%, which is well above where we have been operating and our target range, and was certainly positively influenced by the record revenue of over 7.1 billion. So, do not get used to the 18% operating margins. With the guidance that I've provided for the March quarter, we have effectively guided to slightly over a 12% operating margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, I would just add to that that, as you know, commodity markets cycle, and we realize that right now we are on a very favorable cycle, but we would never project that to continue in the long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a follow-up, if I could, on the iPhone. You decided not to support 3G in the first prototype model. Is that &#x2013; can you talk about your thinking there and how quickly could that change over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point we are very much sold on the 2.5, the Edge network with Cingular because it is much more widespread and widely deployed in the US. We don't comment on our roadmaps et cetera, but obviously we would be where, where the technology is over time.</p>

          <p>We will go now to David Bailey at Goldman Sachs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. Just a question on the Mac side. You saw pretty good sequential up tick in the ASPs, and I was wondering if you are starting to think about maybe pricing a little more aggressively to accelerate Mac growth even more going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Tim. As Peter said, we grew at three times the market, and underneath that if you look in some of specific markets like the US, we grew at 31% versus market growth of 3%, so  just substantially above; portables grew at 65% versus IDC's forecast of 23%. This is also now eight of the last nine quarters that the Mac has outgrown the market, and so &#x2013; I don't see, I believe we have very, very competitive product offerings that are delivering substantially above market growths, and we have no reason to change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the iPod side. Can you give us a general idea, you used to give some of the information about where the iPod gross margin is. Can you help us understand maybe how that is varying from where it used to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we have a long-standing practice of not releasing specific product gross margins. However, the corporate gross margin was over 31%, exceeding our gross margin guidance, and iPod was key in achieving this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Two quick questions. First one, Peter and Tim, just goes to the Mac units in the quarter. Obviously you are taking share and you had a great quarter, but if I look sequentially, you saw units drop in the US and in retail. Would you put some color behind that, was that channel sales, what were the drivers there that caused that sequential drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rebecca, if you look at the Americas as an entity and you combine the retail results, the Mac units sequentially were down 16%. That's exactly the sequential decline the previous year and frankly it's the decline about every year. We have an extremely strong educational business in the Q4 period that includes substantial institutional business, and that institutional business corrects significantly as we get into Q1. And so, the sequential decline that we saw is something that is very seasonal in nature. Frankly, we were very happy to overall have the same number of total Macs that we had in Q4 because we expected that given the high level of institutional sales, including two very large one-to-ones that totaled 50,000 units, we had predicted the Mac to be down from Q4, and it's not, and as Peter said in the preamble, that, combined with the staggering demand on the iPod, allowed us to overachieve our revenue guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I &#x2013;  Another way of interpreting that, though, if I'm understanding correctly, is that your share gains in institutional are pacing about the same rate as your share gains within the US consumer and the holiday buying season patterns that we saw. You have not seen that shift on a year-over-year basis. That sequential pattern, you're not seeing that shift, so that would suggest that your share gains -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind that last year's sequential pattern included a 14-week Q1, and so to have about the same sequential results is actually a very, very positive point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then second question goes to the gross margin, question again, just in terms of better understanding the sustainable leverage. Taking away the commodity environment and the mix environment, which will clearly cycle, you are seeing tremendous leverage in the business. Is there any reason why that isn't sustainable? And as we think longer term, and go out say a year from now and look at next December, where, if we expect growth in the business, we should be thinking and contemplating what the operating leverage looks like. So know that going quarter-to-quarter, you're not going to see that same sort of leverage, but as we think longer term, how much of the gross margin leverage that you experienced in the quarter is sustainable and how meaningful was that really in this past December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rebecca, while I'm guiding to 29.5% for the March quarter, over the longer term, I would continue to target gross margin in the 27 to 28% range despite our recent results, which have benefited from several factors including a favorable commodity environment. Looking forward, we are likely to see other factors that will drive gross margin down, such as a different commodity environment or product mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much of the leverage in the December quarter was &#x2013; or how much of the gross margin differential from your guidance was driven off of leverage? Is that a third of the upside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did not calculate it that way. It helped us, but I would say the bigger drivers were the favorable commodity environment and the product mix.</p>

          <p>Hi. I had two guys, if I could for both you, I think on the first one. International sales, is there any way to give us some color on the international sales, in particular Europe looked pretty good, and the flavor between iPods and CPUs. iPods have in the past few years been traditionally a heavy US orientation. Is that expanding significantly, in other words, was a lot of the upside in your iPods you think driven by sales outside of the US? Is there any color you can give us there on the international sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keith, if you look at Europe in particular, the Mac unit growth in Europe was 28%, and that compares to a market growth of 9%. And so, they were also over three times market. We did grow iPod sales faster outside the United States, which was our goal, if you recall. And as Peter talked about in his opening remarks, we had several countries that did exceptional. We now have five countries that are above 50% and this is in addition to the United States: the UK, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and Japan. And if you look at some of the other countries that we put significant attention to from an advertising point of view and a channel development point of view, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Denmark all gained between 10 and 20 points of share. And so, we felt very, very good about how we did on both the Mac and the iPod internationally, especially in Europe.</p>

It's announced. Will the gross margin on the iPhone be at, better, or worse than the corporate average? Is there any color you can give us there? Because in the past you have given us a little bit of a color as you have introduced new products.</p>

Can you give us just a little more clarity possibly within the iPod side of it, just in terms of where you saw the demands?

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to clarify Peter, on a comment you made earlier, I think you said iPod revenue was lower within the Apple stores on a year-over-year basis. Is that also true on a unit basis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was slightly down, yes. Again, as a result of our expanded channel and our supply and demand being in balance this year where that wasn't the case last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just to clarify something on the gross margin side of the equation. If I look at retail being up about 11% by the looks of it, and if I take a look at the mix shift here, between iPod and Mac, how could we not conclude in effect that the gross margins on the iPod line are not as good now, or better than what they are in the PC line?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again we don't comment specifically on product gross margins. But as I commented before, iPod certainly played a role in the gross margin achievement that we had in the quarter at 30%, which was above our guidance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last questions relate to the channel. Your indication of 200,000 units increase in channel inventory, I just want to make sure from an understanding perspective, that includes all of the iPod units that are resident at all of your 40,000 distribution points?</p>

          <p>Hey, good afternoon. I guess first in terms of the iPhone, Steve Jobs talked about 10 million units, is that for a fiscal '08 or calendar '08, and where did that number come from, maybe just a little bit of logic behind that number?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gene, it's calendar year '08 and it's what Steve referenced in his keynote. And the point that he made was that the worldwide market for total cell phones is somewhere around a billion. And our objective of getting 1% of it would yield 10 million units across the calendar year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so, do you think that &#x2013; I know you talked about a June launch, do you think that that will generally be in kind of full production by June, or do you think this is going to be a situation where it will be relatively &#x2013; because at 10 million units for '08, it just seems pretty low. And I guess if you have availability, it would seem that initially that seemed like that number should be more than easily achievable. So, in other words, do you expect to have capacity constraints at the beginning of the shipment of the iPhone?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you're asking from a demand point of view, I think we'll see as we move forward. It's really too early to tell. From a &#x2013; how we are positioning the product, as Steve indicated in the keynote, we see this is as the DVD player of the 21st century, and so it's clearly not a niche.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just lastly, in terms of the halo effect, some investors are disappointed that the Mac number &#x2013; can you &#x2013; obviously, you are coming up against a tough comp in the September quarter with the educational quarter, and historically you are flat-to-down in December. So, maybe this is just an example of the street getting ahead of themselves, but how do you kind of conceptually think about the halo effect and what inning you are in with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say several things that I feel really indicate that there is a halo effect. One is that we run a three-times market. Two that, in the US, we are &#x2013; we have gone at 31% versus a market of 3. Three, if you look at the latest student monitor information, the intent to buy a Mac is up substantially. As an example, the intent to buy a Mac portable went from 17 to 28% in a year. Also we &#x2013; you know, my view is that we have significant momentum on the Mac. This is the eighth quarter of the last nine that the Mac outgrew the market, and I don't think a lot of people can say that. So, we are thrilled with this number; it is higher than what we projected. I can't speak to the models that you guys have worked, but we are thrilled internally on the number.</p>

It's hard to predict, but we believe that we have got a great line of iPods shipping today with &#x2013; that are a very wide range of prices and capacities and form factors to meet a lot of different needs from different consumers. And so, we will see, and perhaps we will have more on this as we talk again next quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On a longer-term basis, I mean, do you see these two markets legitimately converging? Or is there going to be kind of a place for both kind of a specific iPod-type device and a mobile phone on a longer-term basis?</p>

          <p>Okay. And then just one final follow-up. At the Macworld keynote, I guess last week Steve talked about 50% of all Macs in the quarter &#x2013; I think this was all Macs, not just retail Macs &#x2013; were sold to new users, and it's the first time we've heard that metric. Can you just kind of tell us where that number had been tracking previously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The retail stores for some time have been hitting a number somewhere around 50%. The thing that is new is that this has now expanded to the rest of the channel in the United States, and we feel this is yet another indicator that between the halo effect, and the fact that we have got the best line of Macintoshes we've ever shipped before, and a great OS, it's the total of all of that that has produced this result and we are thrilled about it.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Would you say the iPod gross margin contribution this quarter was due more to better fixed-cost absorption on the higher units, or a better cost structure due to the product refreshes you had at the back half of '06? Basically just trying to figure out where the upside came from in terms of the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Peter. As I commented on an earlier question, I think the larger factors are the ones I cited, were the favorable commodity pricing environment and product mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think the cost structure on the iPods &#x2013; are you pleased with the cost structure with the new refresh at the back half of the year, or do you think that has not changed meaningfully?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Great. Peter, one more question. How about, as far as the cash use on your balance sheet? Maybe you can give us your thoughts in terms of the buybacks and the acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, not really changed from past quarters. Stock buyback programs and other forms of returning cash to the shareholders are reviewed with the senior management and the Board from time to time, but our preference continues to be to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to preserve our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A couple of questions here on the Mac product line. How is the Mac Pro performing versus your expectations now, and your latest thoughts on the transitions to some of the products that the design professionals are looking for? And then also, did Mac Pro help ASPs in the quarter at all? And then I have a couple follow-ups.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me address the total Pro market, which I think is what you are getting at. The Pro market met our expectations internally; however, those expectations were tempered by the fact that some customers are still awaiting the creative suite from Adobe to be released. They did release a beta, and I think there is a lot of positive comments about the beta product, and they have announced that the release will be coming in the second calendar quarter of this year. So just next quarter. So, we would hope to see some of those customers that are delaying purchases begin to buy again at that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then also on Boot Camp downloads, can you update on that? And are you are still on track to add the Boot Camp functionality to Leopard when it's released in the spring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are now up to 1.5 million downloads. So it continues to be of great interest to a number of different people, and our intention is still the same, is to include it in Leopard as we release Leopard in the spring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And one last follow-up on iPods if I could. Could you comment on the linearity of iPod shipments in the first quarter in terms of how the product flowed? Did you have a big burst of product in the month of December, any additional comments on linearity? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a sell-through point of view, December is obviously a very key month, and I would tell you we had weeks that were &#x2013; that the sell-through was just stunning on iPod. That's not necessarily, we obviously ship the product prior to the sell-through, and so the linearity of shipments is pulled to the left in order to accomplish the sell-through.</p>

          <p>Hi. I have a couple of questions. First of all, can you comment on the Cisco lawsuit over the iPhone name, and will that have any potential impact on your ability to ship starting in June? And I have a couple of other follow-ups.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think the Cisco trademark lawsuit is silly, as we've said before. There are already several companies that use the name iPhone for Voice-over-IP products, and we believe that Cisco's US trademark registration is tenuous at best. We are the first company to ever use the iPhone name for a cell phone, and if Cisco wants to challenge us, we are confident we will prevail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then earlier you gave, Tim, I think you gave the iPod, or not, the channel numbers for iPod Mac for this year, can you, do you know what those were for a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="21" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the 40,000 has been relatively consistent for several quarters, although we've taken some channels out and added others. And so, we've added to the channel over that period of time. The Mac number is up 1,500 across last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one other follow-up on &#x2013; I'm kind of a little confused here. I heard you say that Mac units have been typically down sequentially in December over September, but I am looking at the last four years of data, and they have been up every year, including up 25% in the holiday '04. So, I'm kind of a little confused by that comment. So, can you just clarify that again for me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In 2004 we had a very strange occurrence that we had no G5 processors to ship, if you recall, and so we went an entire quarter without shipping the iMac. In fact we pushed the introduction out until the end of that quarter and then shipped very minimal units. That also affected our Pro machine sell-through that quarter. And so, 2004 would not be a good comparison. If you look at 2005 and you look at the Americas line and add retail to it, you would see that sequentially there was a 16% fall, which is the same as this year. That 16% fall was comparing however to a 14-week Q1, and so that suggested we did better this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Hoping to get a feel for how you are thinking about the balance between the very favorable commodity-pricing environment, record gross margins, and top line growth. In other words, are you thinking about getting a little bit more aggressive on iPod pricing in the first half of the year to pass those commodity savings on to customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose our pricing plans obviously, but I would just point out that we sold 21 million iPods, there is not a price issue on iPod. Customers believe they are a great value and I'd make the same point on the Macintosh; they grew at three times the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then to follow up on that. If the number one driver of gross margins was mix and margin performance of the iPod business, why are you expecting margins to fall so much quarter-on-quarter in your fiscal second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've guided gross margin down large as a result of less leverage on fixed cost from the lower revenue. A different product mix including a full quarter of the iPod Shuffle, expect higher music sales from the gift card redemptions, and lower software sales as we approach the Leopard release. Those are the primary factors.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is Tim, Jonathan. Japan &#x2013; two things, one, the PC market in Japan is among the weakest in the world. IDC was projecting a 16% contraction year-over-year in the home market, which is obviously the market that is most important to us. In the MP3 space we maintained a 50% share of the market; however, the market did not grow, and with the lower prices that we announced in September that resulted along with the CPU performance to a lower revenue on a year-over-year basis. We are disappointed with the results, even though they are consistent with the market in both areas, the PC and MP3, and we are putting additional emphasis there including we just started running a localized Mac PC ad that's getting very, very good reviews there.</p>

We opened five stores in the December quarter, would expect to open seven in the March quarter and would expect to open about 35 to 40 in fiscal '07.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. So, you talked about the iPod gross margin increasing better than I guess expected, due to mix and component prices. But can you describe what you mean by mix? Because in my analysis, the Shuffle likely did well, your blended iPod ASP was down 8%. Do you mean the video iPod did perhaps better than you were expecting three months ago? What do you mean by mix exactly?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To clarify, the gross margin was about 300 basis points better than our guidance, and that really resulted from a better commodity environment across all of our commodities. So, not only in iPods, but Macs as well, a better product mix and I'll come back to that. And higher revenue from leveraging the fixed cost with the revenue over performance that we had. As relates to product mix, we saw customers buying up the line. For example, in the Mac business, we had a very strong MacBook Pro quarter, and that certainly helped us from the margin perspective.</p>

      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, within the iPod itself, were there positive mix effects? I would think the video iPod gross margin was higher than the Shuffle gross margin, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, we don't provide individual product gross margins, but our gross margin exceeded our guidance, and the iPod line certainly played a role for us in achieving that result.</p>
