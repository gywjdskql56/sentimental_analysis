          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to this Apple, Incorporated's second quarter 2008 quarterly results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer, and he'll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler for the Q&amp;A session with analysts.</p>
          <p>Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, and earnings, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2007, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, and Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.</p>
          <p>Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak only as of their respective dates.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nancy, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the highest March quarter of revenue and earnings in Apple's history. Revenue in the March quarter was 7.51 billion, an increase of more than 2.2 billion over the previous March quarter's revenue of 5.26 billion. The tremendous growth in the quarter was driven by very strong demand for Macs, higher revenue from iPod and iTunes, and the continued popularity of the iPhone.</p>
          <p>Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 17.5%, primarily due to the higher than anticipated revenue and gross margin. Net income was 1.05 billion, which was up 36% over the prior March quarter's results, and translated to earnings per share of $1.16.</p>
          <p>Before going through the details of the March quarter, I'd like to give you a few data points indicating just how exceptionally well Apple performed. Revenue growth in the March quarter accelerated to 43% year over year, which is more than twice the 21% growth rate we achieved in the March quarter last year.</p>
          <p>We saw healthy growth in all regions, with the US sales growing 40% and international sales growing 47%. Sales in our 208 retail stores, most of which are in the US, were extremely strong, growing 74% year over year, driven in part by traffic of 33.7 million visitors, up 57% from the year ago quarter. In the retail stores, 50% of the CPUs we sold were to customers who were new to the Mac, adding growth to our platform.</p>
          <p>And finally, our US education business generated Mac unit growth of 35% year over year, its highest growth rate in any quarter in the last 8 years.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to talk about our Mac products and services, which represented 59% of total quarterly revenue. We're extremely pleased to have shipped 2.29 million Macs, just shy of the record number of Macs we sold this past holiday quarter and representing 51% growth over the prior March quarter's results. This is 3.5 times the overall PC market rate of growth for the March quarter based on the latest forecast published by IDC, up from the 2 to 3 times market growth rate we had been reporting almost every quarter for the last three years. Sales of desktops grew 37%, driven by strong demand for the iMac as well as increased sales of Mac Pro, which we updated in January.</p>
          <p>Sales of portables grew 61%, driven by continued strong demand for MacBooks and MacBook Pros, both of which were refreshed during the quarter, as well as the successful launch of the MacBook Air. MacBook Air represents a new portable category for Apple and customers have responded very well to its breakthrough design and ultra-portability.</p>
          <p>We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to discuss our music products and services, which accounted for 36% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold 10.6 million iPods, an increase of 1% from the year ago quarter and we experienced about the same seasonal rate of decline between the December and March quarters as we did last year. IPod revenue grew 8% year over year from higher ASPs in every geographic segment due to the success of the iPod Touch. We continue to be very pleased with customer response to the iPod Touch and believe the introduction of the software development kit in late June will broaden its appeal even further as great new applications are developed.</p>
          <p>After declining 17% year over year in the December quarter, Shuffle sales were also down significantly in the March quarter but the weekly rate of sales improved considerably following the February 19 price reduction.</p>
          <p>We continue to achieve our objectives of maintaining our high MP3 market share in the US and gaining share internationally. Our share of the US MP3 market was 73% according to the latest data published by NPD. Outside the US, we gained share in nearly every market we have data for based on the latest information from GFK and BCN. We began and ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.</p>
          <p>Sales from iTunes were very strong during the quarter and NPD reported that we have surpassed Wal-Mart to become the largest music retailer in the US. The iTunes Store has over 50 million customers and over 85% share of the US market for legally purchased and downloaded music based on the latest information from Nielsen SoundScan.</p>
          <p>Our movie rental service has been well received by customers and we have also just begun selling TV shows in Germany and will continue to expand video content internationally.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with iPhone momentum and customer feedback continues to be outstanding. We remain confident in achieving our goal of selling 10 million iPhones in calendar 2008. We sold 1.7 million iPhones during the March quarter and expanded our sales presence to include Austria and Ireland. Total revenue recognized during the quarter from sales of iPhones, iPhone accessories, and payments from carriers was 378 million.</p>
          <p>Total deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV was 1.93 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to 1.44 billion at the end of the December quarter.</p>
          <p>Developer response to the iPhone's 2.0 beta software we announced on March 6 has been tremendous. Over 200,000 developers have signed up and downloaded the software development kit. Interest in the iPhone enterprise beta program has also been off the charts. We received applications from over one-third of the Fortune 500 and over 400 higher-ed institutions. Hundreds of companies and institutions have been accepted into the program and more are being added each week.</p>
          <p>Because we announced these specific new features to be included in the iPhone 2.0 release and plan to provide them to iPhone customers as a free upgrade in late June, we will delay the start of revenue recognition for all iPhones sold on or after our March 6 announcement date until the iPhone 2.0 software is delivered. The revenue and cost of sales associated with these iPhones will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of their respective 24-month estimated lives. Revenue recognition of handsets sold prior to March 6 and payments from carriers has not changed as a result of our announcement.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had another terrific quarter, with revenue growing 74% year over year to 1.45 billion. The stores sold 458,000 Macs during the quarter, an increase of 67% year over year. We opened four stores during the quarter to end with 208. With an average of 205 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was 7.1 million compared to 4.8 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 48%.</p>
          <p>Operating profit doubled year over year to 334 million from 164 million. A primary objective in our stores has been helping people to get more out of their Macs, and the stores delivered 580,000 one-hour personal training sessions during the quarter.</p>
          <p>We opened our 15th store in the United Kingdom during the March quarter and we look forward to opening our first stores in Australia, China, and Switzerland in the coming months. We expect to open about 45 stores during fiscal 2008 and continue to be very confident in the investments we are making in the stores and the asset we are building.</p>
          <p>Total company gross margin was 32.9%, which was a little stronger than our guidance, due to a more favorable commodity environment, higher overall revenue, and a weaker dollar. Operating expenses were 1.16 billion, including 112 million in stock-based compensation expense.</p>
          <p>OI&amp;E was 162 million, below our guidance due to the lower interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>The tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, below the expected 32%, due to higher foreign earnings and lower interest income. We expect the tax rate for the second half of fiscal 2008 to be 31%.</p>
          <p>We generated 1 billion in cash during the quarter, ending with 19.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was 1.2 billion. In the first half of the fiscal 2008, we generated 4 billion in cash from 2.6 billion in net income, the difference being driven largely by the iPhone and strong working capital management.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about 7.2 billion or approximately 33% growth over the prior June quarter. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately 135 million. We expect gross margin to be 33%, reflecting approximately 20 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about 1.185 billion, including about 115 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&amp;E to decline to about 115 million due to the impact of recent interest rate cuts, and we expect the tax rate to be about 31%. We expect to generate EPS of about $1.00.</p>
          <p>In closing, we're extremely proud of our growth and business performance in the March quarter. Our 51% Mac sales increase is the strongest quarterly growth rate we've generated in almost two decades and 3.5 times the market rate of growth. We're very excited about the delivery of the iPhone 2.0 software in late June and the vast potential for compelling solutions that our SDK opens up for the developer community. We remain very confident in our business and continue to be excited about the new products in our pipeline.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thanks a lot; nice revenue and performance. I wanted to ask you a little bit about gross margin. 32.9 was really good but I was wondering if you had thought actually more could flow to the bottom line and what maybe some of the negative cross-currents were. And then also what gives you the confidence of 33% for next quarter? Just a little bit more on that would be helpful. Thanks.  And then I just have a follow-up on iPhones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, maybe I'll let Tim make a few comments about the commodity environment and then let me talk more broadly about gross margin in the March quarter and what we expect in June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Ben, commodity pricing in both DRAM and the NAND Flash markets hit historically low levels during the March quarter. We would expect pricing in the current quarter to remain favorable and we folded that into our guidance. We believe that the LCD market is near a supply/demand balance and will have relatively stable pricing. Hard drives, optical drives, and most other commodities are in a supply/demand balance and we would expect these commodities to follow historical pricing trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and in terms of the quarter, did anything go against you though that was unexpected in the gross margin line or was there an impact from the lower price of the Shuffles that maybe some of us didn't anticipate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, it's Peter. Let me continue on and I'll address that and talk a little bit about the June quarter as well. As we commented in last quarter's call, we expected gross margin to decline by about 2.7%. We actually exceeded our guidance this quarter by 90 basis points and the gross margin only reduced by 1.8%. And the better than expected results were primarily due to the favorable commodity environment that Tim discussed, higher revenue in the quarter, and a weaker dollar.</p>
          <p>The sequential decline from Q1 was primarily due to Leopard entering its second quarter of sales. As we mentioned on last quarter's call and as we have seen in the past, a new OS has significantly more sales in its debut quarter. The change in Leopard and the other Apple software sequentially accounted for over 80% of the gross margin decline that we saw, as we expected.</p>
          <p>Other factors affecting gross margin quarter were the Shuffle price change. We took several international price reductions as a result of a change in currency market, a higher mix of iTunes, which has lower gross margin, and a sequential decline in revenues from the holiday quarter, again which were expected. These factors were somewhat offset by favorable component pricing, allowing us to achieve a gross margin of 32.9%, again which was ahead of our guidance of 32.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was pretty detailed, that's good. In terms of the iPhone, just really switching up, and then I'll cede the floor. With regard to the iPhone, we've all noticed less availability, especially as we got towards the end of the quarter and recently. Is there anything &#x2013; and then we were widely expecting new products but is there anything you can say that will give us confidence that you could grow that segment sequentially given the current amount of supply out there? Is there anything you're worried about and whatnot on the iPhone side in terms of shortages or anything or should we assume you have a handle on that and can grow that business sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, it's Tim. We're confident on hitting the 10 million for the year. I think that would be the main point. In terms of the shortages that you referenced, we expected iPhone to decline more on a sequential basis than it did, so we really beat our unit expectations. As a result, as we got toward the end of the quarter, we started to experience some stock-outs. At this point, both inventory in our stores and our channel inventories are currently low. Our US stores have experienced more stock-outs or relatively more and we believe the reason is that there are more phones being bought there with the intention of unlocking, which remains a significant number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and you don't want to clarify that number at this time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't clarify it. It's not that I don't want to. It's that it's very difficult to come up with a very precise estimate of it. But we do believe the number continues to be significant. And our view continues to be that this is a proxy for the worldwide demand of the phone. And our focus is very much on rolling out to more geos and we're on target to roll out into more countries in Europe and to enter Asia later in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks so much, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ben. Could we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we'll move to Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I wanted to ask a couple of channel questions if I could. Could you guys give some more color on the direct versus indirect mix, and then also could you give us any update on where you are with the expansion of the Best Buy footprint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, the direct sales in the quarter were 53% and that was up from 49 in the year ago quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of Best Buy, we ended with a little over 400 stores, which was to our plan, and we continue to target to be at 600 in the summer. The rollout is going extremely well and we're very, very happy with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a follow-up on education, if I could. With education, can you delineate between your student-buy programs and institutional buying in education, what you experienced this quarter and what you experience for the upcoming quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The numbers that Peter quoted in the preamble, we were up 35% in both institutional and individual buying was relatively strong. The quarter that we're now in is a big K-12 quarter, and of course back-to-school is more of a higher education quarter. I wouldn't want to predict exact numbers, but as Peter had mentioned, the 35% is the highest growth rate we've seen in Ed in 8 years. And we recently learned that we surpassed Dell last year in the portable market share for higher education. So we have significant momentum in this area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there has been a lot of chatter about state and local government spending. Are you guys happy with the institutional part of the education business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm always worried about budgets and will continue to worry about budgets, but the results that we've seen to date with 35% increase year over year, we have not seen any issue today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we'll move on to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. Can you just qualify a little bit more the reasons for the delay of the start of revenue recognition on the iPhone and what your thinking was there based on the 2.0 release, and also what kind of impact we should be &#x2013; how we should think about relaying that into our iPhone numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We are doing this, as I said in my prepared remarks, because we announced specific new features that will be included in the iPhone 2.0 software that we plan to provide for customers for free who purchased after our announcement on March 6. So we will delay revenue recognition on phones sold between March 6 and the date of the delivery of the software. Once we deliver the software, we will resume recognition of &#x2013; revenue recognition of the phones on what we sold between March 6 and that date and begin to recognize, as we have in the past, iPhone revenue on a go-forward basis. As I said in my prepared remarks, this does not impact phones sold prior to March 6 or payments from carriers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so really what we're looking at is just the exclusion of hardware revenue next quarter really from iPhone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Until the software is delivered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on the iPhone with regard to your 10 million guidance, can you talk a little bit about how important either 3G might be to that or how important at least the timing of some of your pending products that you're referring to in your press release and on your excitement around the iPhone weighs into that 10 million &#x2013; based on current momentum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't comment on new products, but I would just reiterate that we're confident with hitting the 10 million. And obviously a part of that is rolling out to more geographies and we've been working very hard at this, and feel confident that we'll be able to roll out in more places in Europe and to enter Asia during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does that forecast include some now going forward assumption in your part of an unlocked phone percentage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The unit number includes phones of all types, locked and unlocked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then final question. You haven't said anything in your call about economic headwinds. It's obviously something people are focusing on. It seems you're benefiting from resistance to some of those headwinds and also share gains. Any commentary you can offer in addition to the comments you've made to help us understand some of the sustained drivers of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, it's Peter. We're going to leave economic commentary to others, and we're focused on managing our business, which performed exceptionally well in the March quarter. And I credit it to just outstanding, innovative products that drove amazing results. The US business performed quite well in March. Our revenue grew 40%. And this growth rate was twice last year's March quarter US growth rate of 20, and faster than we grew in the December quarter of 27%. Mac sales in the US were up 51%, and traffic through our stores were up 12 million people year over year. And we only have 208 stores. So we remain very confident in our business and in our strategy, and we'll continue to invest in hardware and software products to delight our customers. We read the same things that you do, but I provided guidance for the June quarter, which has revenue growing at 33%. And again, that is in acceleration from the rate we saw last June by about 10 points.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, what we said is we intend to deliver the iPhone 2.0 software in late June, and I've included the delay in revenue recognition in the 33% gross margin that I've given you for the quarter. And again, this affects iPhone handset sales only between March 6 and when we deliver the software, and it does not impact phones sold prior to March 6 or payments from carriers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is fair to say it does have a negative impact on gross margin during that period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will not recognize revenue until we deliver the software, and so that has an impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on your target for the June quarter, you have revenue down I think 4% quarter over quarter and typically it's up. Is there any particular area that you expect to be sub-seasonal in the next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk a little bit, Tom, about it. We're guiding to 7.2 billion, which again is a 33% increase from the year ago quarter, and is an acceleration of about 10 points from what we saw last June when we grew 24%. We factored several things into our thinking. First, our Mac channel inventory this past quarter did increase by about 60,000 in the March quarter as a result of the MacBook Air launch and accelerated sales velocity. Second, we will not begin recognition of new iPhone sales until we deliver the iPhone 2.0 software in late June as I have discussed. Third, we expect a sequential decrease in iPod sales as we've seen in the last couple of years, so nothing new there. And fourth, we'll see the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle and some international price reductions that we took in February. So that's what went into our thinking, but again, I couldn't be happier with the performance of the business. I think the guidance we're giving is very strong and we'll just end by saying again, it's a growth rate that is faster than what we saw in the year-ago quarter.</p>

          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. I want to go back to the margin question because this is the first quarter that gross and operating margins are down year on year since March of '06. Peter, do you feel that you now need to reinvest some of the margin upside to address the growth opportunities internationally and in some of the new product categories such that year-on-year declines will be more of the norm going forward, or was there something specific in the calendar first quarter that will go away later this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Katy, again when we gave you our guidance in January, we gave guidance for 32% gross margin and we reported 32.9, so we did better than we thought. So our gross margin was better than what we had expected. We are continuing to come out with new, innovative products. It is a competitive world. And we are thinking thoughtfully about driving growth both in our top and bottom lines and continuing to gain market share in all three of our product areas.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Peter, just quickly, are you still planning to open about half of the new stores internationally this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if it will be quite half but our international store openings will be greater this year than they were last. As of the end of the quarter, we had 208 stores open in total and 27 of those were outside the US. And we've increased our store opening forecast this year by a little bit to 45 stores for the year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter and Tim and everybody, actually. I wanted to ask about the gross margin. I'm still struggling to understand the gross margin that you reported in the quarter. I understand that you said that the decline in Leopard sales represented the biggest portion of that. But it looked like from the segment data that you reported that Leopard revenue was down about 100 million sequentially perhaps. And so that would be about a point of impact on the gross margin sequentially. And given the price cut you did on Shuffle, it seems like that at most was another point impact on the gross margin. And yet since October, we've had DRAM and NAND pricing down 60 to 70% or more and panel pricing has been pretty favorable as well.</p>
          <p>So I'm just wondering if there was anything about the timing of when you procured the components that went into the systems that you built in Q1 that had an impact on the gross margin. In other words, was a lot of the NAND and DRAM that went into Q1 products procured in the December quarter? And if that's the case, should we expect to get some benefit as you procure a lot of NAND and DRAM now at much lower prices on the Q2 gross margin? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, I'd like to make a couple comments about some of the first things you said and then Tim can address some of your later points. Our Leopard revenues in the December quarter, as we talked about last in January, was 170 million, and they were just over 40 million in the March quarter; so together, a little over 210 million in the first half. Leopard is by far the best selling release in our history. But sequential decline in Leopard and also iLife and iWork went into its third quarter were a bit greater than what you thought. So the impact of sequential gross margin decline therefore was a little bigger. And you also have to factor in, in addition to the pricing actions that we took, lower sequential revenue, so we had less leverage on fixed costs. And iTunes was a bigger mix of the business this quarter than last, and it has a lower gross margin as well. So there were a number of factors that played into the gross margin coming down, but again, it's better than what we expected it to be. We guided to 32 and achieved 32.9. Tim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just add, Rich, that the component advantages, as you said, were large during the quarter, and those really offset most of the lighter points that Peter talked about, which were the Shuffle price cut, the international price cuts that we did to adjust for currency, the higher mix of iTunes sales, and the lower overall revenue and the effect it has on the structure. And so we did receive significant benefit, particularly in the DRAM and NAND Flash areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could follow-up, Tim, with one other question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned that you said that you thought that memory pricing would continue to be very favorable in the June quarter. And yet in the case of both DRAM and NAND, we're at very, very low levels and in many cases for many suppliers, close to cash cost. What gives you confidence I guess that the pricing will continue to be favorable here as we go into the second quarter and you and other companies start to procure more DRAM and NAND for a typical seasonal build.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be specific here, favorable does not mean that it goes lower than where it was in March. It means that we envision it trading in a fairly narrow trading range, and therefore, not increasing that much as we head into the quarter. But I don't believe that it will go lower because as you say, many people are already charging, certainly not absorbing all of their fixed costs in the current prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure, just a couple of quick things, one on OI&amp;E. Is there anything aside from lower interest rates given your cash flows leading to a lower number? Two, can you give us a sense about what the delay in the iPhone recognition meant to the current quarter? Three, the tax rate, can you clarify whether it was down this quarter and that 31%, could we use that going forward? And last just in terms of as you look at the consumer, obviously you had great numbers. But are you seeing any impact in the consumer? Are you taking any steps to address that? Can you just talk about consumer behavior in general?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll certainly come back to it, and I'm going to actually just probably go in reverse order. In terms of the consumer, we had a very good December quarter, and we had an amazing March quarter. In my prepared remarks, I wanted to go through some things that I thought would be helpful to you, and I think in a prior question, I did, but I'll go back through just a couple of them, particularly in the US.</p>
          <p>Our revenues in the United States grew 40% year over year. Mac shipments were up 51% in the US, basically at the level we saw around the world. And we saw about 34 million people in our 208 retail stores, most of which were in the US, so our business performed exceptionally well in the March quarter across each of our customer segments, including our retail stores.</p>
          <p>In terms of the tax rate, we had been forecasting 32% for the year. With a higher mix of foreign earnings that we saw in the March quarter and lower interest income really as a result of the rate environment, our tax rate for the year looks to be 31%, and so that's what we're forecasting for the June quarter and for the September quarter. And so in order to get to 31% for the year, we had an adjustment in the March quarter. And that's why the tax rate was 29%.</p>
          <p>Then, I know that you had an OI&amp;E question, which I am going to let Gary answer. But was there one other before I turn it over to Gary?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The impact of the iPhone recognition in the current quarter, is there a way to quantify what that was?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'll have to make your estimates, but we sold 1.7 million phones during the quarter. We made the announcement on March 6. You know what we sell the phones for and we recognize the revenue over 24 months. Gary?</p>

          <p>Just to clarify that, the number that you sold, that's still in the &#x2013; I just want to make sure I understand it. So that of the &#x2013; after March 6, you still counted them as shipments, you just don't show the revenue is what you're saying?</p>

          <p>Yes; hi, Andy. I think you asked if there was anything else in the OI&amp;E besides lower effective yields, and the answer is no. We're basically investing in very short-dated, high quality, highly liquid instruments. And as a consequence, the yield on our portfolio has dropped a little bit, 4.9% a quarter ago. We exited the last quarter, we were running about 3.9%. We expect it to go down a little bit more. And there wasn't any material write-offs in the portfolio. In regard to investments and auction rate securities and asset-backed securities, we don't have any of those.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Hopefully, one last question on the iPhone and the March 6 date, so you obviously recognize &#x2013; do not recognize the revenue after March 6, but you would recognize the costs and expenses related to that? Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Gene, we will delay recognition of both the revenue and the product cost on the iPhone from &#x2013; beginning on March 6 until we release the software. But we'll continue to expense our operating expenses around selling and advertising and engineering as period costs as we always have</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the customers that purchased the phone on or after March 6 presumably were aware of the software that we told them that we were going to come out with and that they were going to get it for free.

In Europe, we were up 48; in Japan, we were up 47. It's very solid throughout. In Asia-Pacific, we were actually up 62, and so these are obviously all multiples to the market growth. Within each of those, the consumer appears to be very strong. Our Pro Business also had a very nice pickup last quarter. The Mac Pro sold more units since it debuted with the new Intel processor. Education was up 35% in the US, and so overall, just strength everywhere. We felt very good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Peter, when you in fact shipped the SDK, is there a catch-up period for the phones that were shipped, or is it all ratably from that point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understand your question, Keith, we will begin to recognize the revenue and the product cost from this once we ship the 2.0 Software over the remaining lives of the &#x2013; remaining lives for the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is no catch-up period, it will be ratably from that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ratably, yes, over the remaining life.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Fair enough, okay. And then Peter, I want to go to the gross margin side. When I look overt year-over-year comps, gross margins were down about 220 basis points. You flagged some areas that were different on the sequential basis. Leopard would be out of the equation. In fact, software was a richer mix when you look at March to March. Could you just pick out a couple of the other large drivers of change on a year-over-year basis, and particularly if you could identify whether the mix between CPUs and iPods was favorable or unfavorable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keith, it's really hard for me to do year-over-year gross margin comparisons because you've got your different points in your product cycles, different commodity cycles, different mix. And that's why we've traditionally talked about gross margin on a sequential detail. I'd prefer to just stick with the sequential comments that I gave you, which again gross margin was better than what we thought it would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, fair enough. Then last question from me then, Peter. If you &#x2013; you have your operating segments, and if you thought about, is there a deviation in the operating segments in the amount of gross margin they report by geography? In other words, was the variance in terms of the individual geographies materially different than what you had as a company as a whole?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll put out the 10-Q in the next week or so and our segment reporting at the gross margin level will be there. You can look at prior 10-Qs to see the different gross margins in the segments, and there is a little bit of variability. But we're quite happy with each of our segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Peter, I just wanted to touch on the Mac side. When you look at PC unit growth, typically it's down quarter over quarter in the calendar second quarter. Given your strength has accelerated to about three times the market growth, I wonder if you can highlight any comparable seasonality in the Mac business in your June quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. What we generally see in June is a sequential increase in Mac shipments as the education buying season begins. The June quarter tends to be more heavily weighted to K-12, which buys typically at lower ASPs, and the September quarter tends to be more heavily weighted within the Ed buying season by higher education.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I have just one follow-up. If I move over to the iPhone, when you look at the unlocked or non-activated phones in the prior quarter, some of that was gifts that were bought late in the holiday season. Have you seen any change in behavior from the carryover from the December quarter when they actually activated? Have you seen any just significant changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Tim commented, it's really hard to estimate precisely, and we don't want to throw a number out. Unlocking is occurring and it is significant. But our view is that this is just a clear interest in demand globally for the iPhone. And we think we're hearing reports of iPhones being used in many countries, and this is one of the things that gives us confidence in our goal of shipping about 10 million in calendar 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Could we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We'll move to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could reconcile your statement that iPhone demand was outstripping supply at the end of the quarter with what appears to be an excess supply in most European countries of the phone. As you indicated, they can price as they want and we're seeing price cuts of over 50% on the phone which certainly doesn't sound like a situation where they're undersupplied. Were you seeing a noticeably different demand profile in the US relative to your expectations versus Europe? And if so, why couldn't you simply ship phones from what appears to be an overstocked Europe to the US to fulfill that demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Toni, my point was that stock-outs were occurring in our own stores towards the end of the quarter. And we believe that that was because our stores are more susceptible to people going in and buying multiple units and then unlocking and exporting them. However, I also added that currently, inventories are low in both our stores and in the channel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that also the case in your European channel? Or is that an aggregate channel statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I don't want to be specific at the carrier level, but in the aggregate, Europe is low. In the aggregate, the US is low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And at the very end of the quarter where you were having stock-outs in your own stores, was your channel inventory also low? Because it seemed like the phones were readily available in Europe and through AT&amp;T stores, which obviously begged the question of why were you not able to better balance the allocation of phones, particularly towards the end of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Once the units already shipped and designated to a carrier, the ability to move them from carrier to carrier is very low. And so you can have very short-term cases where there is some imbalance. But I think the major point is that we sold more than we thought we would, and that today, inventories are low in aggregate in Europe and in aggregate in the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on whether you thought you sold more in Europe than you thought you would?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm just going to comment that in total, we sold more than we expected. We expected a sharper seasonal decline than what we experienced. And as you know, this was our first Q1 to Q2 that we've been in the phone business, and so we've learned something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then staying with the phone, I know a couple other people have asked, but last quarter on this call, you said you weren't comfortable discussing the unlocked percentage because of the high concentration of phones that had been sold at the very end of December in the holiday season, and that you felt you'd get a beater read on that in January. Invariably you have gotten a better read on that. And so, given that you had given out the number before, an estimate of that number, why the reticence now given at least for last quarter, you should have ample ability to be able to quantify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't feel that we can quantify it with precision and so we don't want to put out a number that we can't stand behind. But we've gone out of our way to classify the number as significant, and I'm not sure how to be more clear than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then switching to Macs, your notebook ASP declined sequentially and year over year, given that you introduced the MacBook Pro which sounded like it got off to a good start, and you also mentioned strength in MacBook Pros. Were those both relatively small and were price cuts relatively big? Or how do we reconcile the ASP decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Toni, it's Peter. The ASP decline was slight both on a sequential and year-over-year basis and they were largely driven by the transition that we had in the quarter and some mix shifts within our MacBook and MacBook Pro lines. But again, they were small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have a couple of questions. One is do you have any color that you can provide on the demographics of MacBook Air purchases? I originally thought it would be for road warriors, but the numbers suggest it's selling far better than that. And in the same vein, do you have any sense of how many Windows users purchased a MacBook Air?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't on the latter, Charlie. What we would share is that it is appealing to all sorts of people from college professors to students to people that travel a lot. It seems to have universal appeal. And also, the cannibalization factor was extremely low to the other portables, which is one of the key reasons we were able to have a very minor sequential decline from Q1, where usually it would be much deeper.</p>
