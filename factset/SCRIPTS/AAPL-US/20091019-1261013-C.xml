          <p>Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this Apple Incorporated fourth quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Miss Nancy Paxton, senior director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer, and he'll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler for the Q&amp;A session with analysts. Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.</p>

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, we'd speak as of their respective dates.</p>
          <p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased to report Apple's most profitable quarter ever in sales of more Macs and iPhones than in any previous quarter. We're thrilled with these record-breaking results particularly given the economic environment around us. Revenue for the quarter was 9.87 billion, representing 25% growth over the prior September quarter's result. This was Apple's second highest quarterly revenue ever next to the record results reported for last December quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating margin was Apple's highest ever at 2.19 billion, representing over 22% of revenue and higher than our guidance due to better than expected revenue and gross margin. Net income was 1.67 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.82. In terms of non-GAAP measures, adjusted sales totaled 12.25 billion for the September quarter, which was almost 2.4 billion higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was 5.21 billion, which was almost 1.6 billion higher than our reported gross margin. And adjusted net income was 2.85 billion or almost 1.2 billion higher than our reported net income.</p>
          <p>We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis and understanding of our performance in the September quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to the details of our results, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated outstanding Mac sales of 3.05 million, beating our previous record set in the year-ago quarter by over 440,000. The Mac is showing fantastic momentum growing faster than the market in 19 of the past 20 quarters. We believe this is a result of our unmatched innovation and commitment to providing customers with the best hardware, the best software and the best user experience in the world. Quarterly Mac sales grew 17% year over year and this compares extremely favorably to IDC's latest published estimate of 2% growth for the market overall in the September quarter.</p>
          <p>Customers continue to respond very positively to our Mac portable line-up, which we updated in June. Portable sales increased 35% year over year and represented 74% of our Mac mix. Our execution in the quarter was outstanding and we were particularly pleased with the 42% year-over-year growth in our Asia Pacific segment. We once again had a very successful back-to-school season, and we're very pleased with a 12% year-over-year increase in Mac sales to U.S. education institutions, which resulted in the highest quarterly Mac sales ever for our U.S. education business. The shipments to U.S. education institutions this quarter included 50,000 MacBooks to the State of Maine as part of its ongoing one-to-one initiative.</p>
          <p>Customer response to the August 28 release of Snow Leopard has been tremendous. Through the end of the September quarter, we generated consumer box upgrade sales at twice the rate we experienced with the Leopard release. Snow Leopard delivers hundreds of refinements, is the only operating system to support Exchange out of the box and has successfully introduced new core technologies. Snow Leopard allows developers to take full advantage of hardware features, including 64-bit technology, multicore processors and advanced graphics processing units. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks	 of Mac channel inventory.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn to our music products. We sold almost 10.2 million iPods, which was down from just over 11 million in the year-ago quarter. Our latest research indicates that 50% of recent iPod buyers were purchasing their first iPod, including those in our high market share countries such as the U.S., Japan, Australia, Canada and the UK. Customers love the recently announced iPod nano's new features including the built-in video camera, FM radio, pedometer and larger display. Sales of iPod touch grew strongly during the quarter, up 100% year over year, fueled by a very successful back-to-school season and the continued incredible popularity of the App Store.</p>
          <p>With the new $199 entry price point for the iPod touch and the updated features to the iPod shuffle, nano and classic, we believe the iPod line-up is attractively positioned for the holiday season. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD, and iPod was the top selling MP3 player and continued to gain share year over year in nearly every country we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.</p>
          <p>The iTunes Store delivered another great quarter with strong sales of music, video and Apps. Customers are loving last month's release of iTunes 9 and its many new features, including iTunes LP, Home Sharing and Genius Mixes as well as improved syncing and the redesigned iTunes Store. With stores in 23 countries, iTunes is the world's largest music retailer now offering over 11 million songs in addition to over 50,000 TV episodes and 7,500 films.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold almost 7.4 million handsets in the September quarter. That's a new company record and an increase of 7% over the prior September quarter when we increased channel inventory by two million handsets following the introduction of the iPhone 3G and the dramatic expansion of geographic distribution. iPhone sell-through in the quarter increased 38% year over year.</p>
          <p>Response to the new iPhone 3GS has continued to be tremendous, and we were very pleased with J.D. Power &amp; Associates' announcement earlier this month that iPhone has once again topped the charts for both consumer and business smartphone customer satisfaction. iPhone not only maintained its lead since the last J.D. Power report was issued six months ago, but it widened it over the next closest competitor in both categories. We are looking forward to selling iPhones in China beginning later this month as this very large market represents a great opportunity to expand iPhone's reach even more broadly. We also plan to expand our carrier relationships in the UK and Canada.</p>
          <p>The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success, with over 85,000 apps available and over two billion customer downloads to date including over half a billion downloads in the September quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition to adding more apps at an amazing pace, we've continued to enhance the App Store experience with iPhone OS 3.1 which includes new features such as Genius recommendations and a streamlined way to organize apps within iTunes. Recognized revenue from the iPhone handset sales, accessory sales, and carrier payments was 2.3 billion during the quarter compared to 806 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 185%. The sales value of iPhones sold during the quarter was 4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. The stores had a record quarter posting the highest revenue, segment margin and Mac sales ever. Revenue in the quarter was 1.87 billion compared to 1.72 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our stores sold 670,000 Macs compared to 596,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened 15 new stores during the quarter, bringing us to a total of 273. With an average of 262 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was 7.1 million compared to 7.6 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Retail segment margin was 410 million or 22%, up from 301 million, or 17.5% in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 45.9 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 42.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 7%. We hosted 608,000 personal training sessions and we sold 208,000 memberships through our One-to-One program, an increase of over 120% year over year.</p>
          <p>Fiscal 2009 was a milestone year for our Retail Stores. In addition to opening 26 new stores, we remodeled 72 stores to our updated design and for the first time, we opened more stores internationally than in the United States. In November, we plan to open our first two stores in France, including one at the Louvre as well as our fourth high profile store in Manhattan on the Upper West Side.</p>
          <p>Total Company gross margin was 36.6%, which was 260 basis points better than our guidance. There were two groups of factors that were the primary cause of this difference. First, we sold more Snow Leopard, had a better product mix, and spent less on the iPod transition than planned. Second, component costs did increase but not to the level we had expected, and we benefited from leverage on the higher revenue and lower freight and other costs than planned.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were 1.42 billion and included 151 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&amp;E was 45 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled 34 billion at the end of the September quarter compared to 31.1 billion at the end of the June quarter, an increase of 2.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was 3.1 billion and that was net of our 500 million pre-payment to Toshiba early in the September quarter to secure future supply of NAND Flash. Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital, which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high-quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. On September 23, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified EITF 09-3, which will change the way that we account for iPhone and Apple TV today. Under EITF 09-3 only the estimated sales value of future upgrade rights to iPhone and Apple TV software are required to be deferred at the time of sale with the balance of the iPhone and Apple TV sales price being recognized immediately as revenue.</p>
          <p>The deferred amounts will be recognized over the 24-month estimated lives of the product, similar to the way we have applied subscription accounting to these product sales today. We don't know at this time the specific amount of revenue deferral for each iPhone and Apple TV sold under EITF 09-3, but we do believe that a substantial portion of the revenue will be recognized for these products at the time of sale.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the FASB adoption of this new rule as we believe it will enable us to more closely align our reported results with the economics of the iPhone and Apple TV sales. We will be required to adopt the new accounting rule no later than the first quarter of our fiscal 2011, a year from now, but we do have the option of adopting earlier than that some time in our fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact of the new rule on our accounting and reporting system and processes. Making this change will be complex and as of now we are uncertain as to the timing of our adoption. Therefore, we don't have anything more specific to discuss with you today about this change.</p>
          <p>The guidance for the December quarter that we are providing today is based on a subscription accounting treatment that we have applied to-date for the iPhone and Apple TV sales. In other words, it is based on the assumption that the full amounts of revenue and product costs for past and future iPhone and Apple TV sales continue to be recognized ratably over the estimated 24-month lives of the product.</p>
          <p>Forecasting the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging so we will continue to provide a range of guidance for the December quarter. For the December quarter, we expect revenue to be between about 11.3 billion and 11.6 billion. We expect gross margin to be about 34%, reflecting approximately 33 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about 1.64 billion, including about 178 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&amp;E to be about 30 million reflective of the short-term interest rate environment, and we expect the tax rate to be about 30%. We are targeting EPS in the range of about $1.70 to $1.78.</p>
          <p>In closing, we are thrilled with our outstanding September quarter results and with our record fiscal 2009. For the year, we generated 36.5 billion in revenue and 5.7 billion in net income. That's 12% annual revenue growth and 18% net income growth in extraordinary challenging economic times. During the year, we continued to introduce incredibly innovative products, including the new aluminum unibody MacBook Pro, the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone OS 3.0, Mac OS X Snow Leopard and, of course, the wildly popular new features and offerings in iTunes and the App Store. As we begin our fiscal 2010, we're looking forward to delivering additional, exciting new products and are confident in our new product pipeline.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on our strategy of bringing the best and most innovative products and solutions to our customers and we are very enthusiastic about the year ahead. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question will come from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Peter, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the factors informing your guidance for the following quarter. Specifically, why the sequential jump in revenue is so far below what you've experienced for the last couple of years, and also, why gross margin should be down as much as you've got it sequentially, the main factors there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with gross margin. I'll come back to revenue. We expect gross margin to decline sequentially, about 34% primarily as a result of four factors. First, for the new products that we have and will announce, we're delivering greater value to our customers and these products have lower gross margins than their predecessors. Second and as expected, we will see a seasonally higher mix of iPods and expect Snow Leopard box sales to be less in their second quarter. And third, we'll incur significantly more airfreight and fourth, we expect component costs to be higher than what we saw in the September quarter.</p>
          <p>You know, regarding our revenue, as you know, the education and back-to-school seasons have largely concluded. And the December quarter has been typically driven by holiday purchases in the second half of the quarter. Our guidance this quarter includes double-digit revenue growth from last year, which was the best quarter from a revenue perspective in Apple's history. We're also seeing lower ASPs this year but, Rich, we remain very confident in our business. We're shipping the best products that we ever have in Apple's history, and customers have clearly responded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rich. Can we have the next question, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>From Barclay's Capital, we'll hear from Ben Reitzes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks a lot. Could you discuss, I had two questions, one on iPhone. Can you discuss channel inventory, what it was ending the quarter, and what the supply situation is, if there are any supply constraints during the quarter?</p>
          <p>We noticed lack of availability overseas and then that looked alleviated towards the end of the quarter and it would seem like there's pent-up demand heading into December. So, if you could discuss that, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Ben. It's Tim. For much of the quarter, most of the countries where we're selling the iPhone 3GS was very low in inventory as demand outstripped the supply. We did improve supply markedly in September, and supply and demand converged in the vast majority of countries either in September or in early October. In terms of your channel inventory question, we now have about 2.4 million units in the channel, and that's an additional 585,000 from the previous quarter end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you comfortable with that, given that you have China launching and maybe even a few other geos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would have liked to have had more, honestly, because we were still short in some countries at quarter end. As I indicated, it was early October before we were able to get supply and demand balanced in some countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you don't want to quantify China maybe, but is there any certain levels of excitement you have and any limitations in terms of apps and iTunes that may limit the sales out of the gate, or anything else you'd say qualitatively around that launch that gives us an idea of the velocity of units?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're thrilled to be launching there on October 30 with China Unicom and we're going to start with about 1,000 points of sale and then expand further over the next several months thereafter. They've announced the plans and prices that they'll have for the device and for the service, and there's a very wide range here from &#x2013; on the post-paid side from $18 a month all the way up to 85, $100 a month, and at the higher price points, an individual is able to actually get the device for free, and it goes up as you go down the ARPU as it would in most countries.</p>
          <p>As you know, as we shipped the 3G and the 2G phone prior to that, we discovered that there were quite a few phones going into China, so it would seem to us to indicate that there's a good opportunity, and we're really excited to get started. We're not making any projections on volume but it's a huge market. The largest market in the world in terms of total phone, and I think it's very important that we get started to make it as large as possible on smartphones.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, and congratulations. If we're looking at the iPhone, it's pretty clear we're still in a greenfield opportunity here, but as you start to go to multiple carriers, can you talk a little bit about the pricing of the phone when you go from exclusivity to multiple carriers, and obviously not specifics but any sort of color we can have in terms of how the pricing dynamic changes from the phone from you to the carrier? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our pricing is confidential, Gene. So it's not something I can comment on in detail, but generally speaking from markets where we're already selling, there would not &#x2013; I would not expect to see a wholesale price difference as we bring on other carriers. However, the end-user price is really set by the carrier themselves, and so you may or may not see a street price difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you go from exclusive to multiple carriers, you wouldn't necessarily see a change in pricing that you're charging the carrier, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Tim, I know you guys don't have a lot of experience with the seasonality in the iPhone business, but how do you think about the seasonality here into the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then a question for Peter on tax. Can you walk us through why the tax rate is going to go up here in the near term? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Scott, as you said, when we look at the September to December quarter we have very few September to Decembers to look at in the iPhone business since we have just been selling for a couple of years, and, in fact, in the vast majority of countries, we've only been selling in <mark type="inaudible" /> and some of those just a partial. And, so honestly speaking, we're new in the business still, and I think for me to make any kind of seasonality forecasts would not be a good idea.</p>
          <p>The things that we look at in terms of coming up with our forecasts would be the popularity of the iPhone 3GS has been phenomenal. We were very surprised by the demand. We were selling in 64 countries by the end of the quarter. We'll roll out some others this quarter. Notably China which has already been mentioned in the call. We hope to roll out in Korea as well, and as Gene mentioned previously, we will be adding some carriers in some countries where we only had one carrier before, such as the United Kingdom and Canada as an example. So those are the things that we think about as we think about our December forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, and related to your tax question, our tax rate for the quarter was 26%, and it was below our guidance of 30. Primarily due to a higher mix of foreign earnings, but for the year, we were about 29%. The past two years, we've been pretty much right on 30. So from what I see at this point for fiscal '010 would be about 30% for our tax rate. Really consistent with what we have seen in the last couple of years.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Tim, what are your thoughts in the holiday season given the increase in competitive intensity against the iPhone? There's a lot of, obviously, wannabes that are coming to market in that season, specifically Android and many of them are offering touch screens and richer browsing and media and app stores and are being given carrier support. How do you think about maintaining your momentum and differentiation amidst that kind of environment?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mike, we feel great about how we ended the fiscal year with selling 7.4 million, as Peter talked about in the preamble, and that put us over 20 million, almost 21 million for the fiscal year which was up 78% from before, and so we have significant momentum. Also when you look at the ecosystem that we've got with iTune and the App Store &#x2013; the App Store having over 85,000 apps, which is a country mile more than anyone else, plus the very strong product pipeline that we have, we feel very, very good about suiting up and competing against anyone.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Can you talk a bit about the Mac business? You know, the channel inventory levels, what the mix has been now that you've had a couple of &#x2013; a few months since the refresh of your line-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Shannon. This is Tim. Last quarter was the quarter of the portable, up 35% year over year. Compared to IDC at 9% and so we really had a blowout quarter for portables, and it's the result of the line-up that we announced in June and as you know, we had backlog entering the quarter on that line. Also the Mac was helped by the back-to-school which was the strongest back-to-school that we ever had as Peter talked about and the launch of Snow Leopard, which occurred later in the quarter and so there was a group of things that came together to push us to a level above three million, which was beyond our own expectations internally or even some of our stretch targets.</p>
          <p>From a channel inventory point of view, we started the quarter between three and four weeks. We ended the quarter between three and four weeks, and to be specific on the inventory change so there's no misunderstanding, the inventory changed less than 15,000 units from beginning to end, and so we had very minor growth, particularly when you compare that to the growth in sales from a sequential point of view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>The upgrade sales of Snow Leopard, which we include the family-in-the-box set were more than double what we experienced for Leopard over the same five-week initial sales period and so this doubling was much more than we had planned and was very pleasantly surprised by it.</p>

I don't want to make forecasts today for future quarters on a quantitative basis, but I think there's two things that you ought to be aware of. First, for some key components, costs are rising.

          <p>In an exclusive relationship, you can generally have some level of innovation that's very difficult or would be more difficult to do with several carriers. Visual voicemail was an example of that that we had in the initial iPhone as you recall. Also in some cases, a exclusive carrier may be willing to invest more. Although there is &#x2013; we found no lack of people wanting to sell iPhone frankly. And so I'm not sure whether that is true on a broad basis or not, but I think that's may be true in some individual cases. And other than that, I would ask them because they can probably give you a better view than I could.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions here. Tim, could you give us any sort of sense qualitatively in terms of what Apple has seen with respect to the impact of the remodeled stores as well as the increasing penetration of the Apple Retail Stores internationally? Are you seeing any sort of synergies, both with your direct and indirect sales levels because of these initiatives, or is it still too early to be determined?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Peter. I'll take that question. No, we are seeing strong results from our remodeled stores. Ron and his team have remodeled, as I said this year, 72 of the stores to bring them to our most updated design, and those designs are providing the best customer &#x2013; customer experience in the industry bar none. Whether it be up front in the selling part of the store or certainly in the back of the store with the Genius Bars or the Creative Bars, and customers are having a great experience. In terms of international, the growth there was quite strong in the quarter. Our average store revenue was actually up over 20% for our international stores this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then Peter, the other question revolves around the OpEx ratio going forward. You talked in your prepared remarks about 2010, a new product pipeline. Can you give us any sense in terms of how should investors think about the R&amp;D or SG&amp;A moving up? Is it going to kind of hold steady, or will there be any sort of changes regarding that pipeline?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to give a specific quantitative percent. I think over the last year we have managed operating expenses well, but we have been investing confidently for our future, especially in engineering and our distribution and our marketing and advertising. We saw the benefit in the last downturn, in 2001 and 2002, of coming out of that with just an amazingly product strong pipeline, and we're repeating that very positive lesson this time around. So I think we're being careful with money. We're making good choices and &#x2013; but continuing to invest wisely and confidently in our future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. A couple of questions, please. You had very strong ASP performance in both Macs and the iPhone. On the Mac side, you're typically down because of the back-to-school promotion because of ASPs. You were up even on the notebook side this quarter. Can you comment on that? And then the iPhone side, it does look like your ASP went up 40 or $50 sequentially on a cash basis. You had stated the last quarter that 3GS was outstripping the $99 phone. So was it mix alone, or is there something else around currency translation or something else that is affecting that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Toni. It's Peter. Let me start with iPhone. The iPhone ASP in the quarter was just over $600, and this reflected both a high mix of the 3GS sell-through and also the benefit of rebalancing the ending channel inventory more towards the 3GS as a result of the introduction.</p>
          <p>On a sequential basis, yes, our ASPs were up a bit in the portable space. This was really a function of our seeing a higher mix of our new MacBook Pros. As Tim commented, very, very strong quarter after the June introduction. We had the best back-to-school season that we have ever had, and on a sequential basis, we also got a little benefit from the dollar as well. On a year-over-year basis, the dollar was a negative, but sequentially, it was a small positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the availability issues that you had on the phone, was that a good, old-fashioned demand exceeds supply issue, or were there any component availability issues that constrained your supply? And related to that, you had also mentioned that air freight, you expected to go up next quarter as a reason for gross margins. I'm not sure if that was in relation to phones or anything else, but perhaps you can address that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the availability portion, Toni, the iPhone 3GS demand outstripped the supply of the iPhone 3GS, and so I think you would probably put that in your first category of a good old-fashioned &#x2013; a demand issue which is a nice problem to have in the scheme of things. Now, because we &#x2013; because it was outstripping supply, it creates component shortages as we go out to the market to secure more components. And generally speaking, the ones that are hardest to get is silicon, and so it takes a little longer.</p>
          <p>However, I was really happy that we were able to solve the bulk of these &#x2013; the vast majority of them in September or in early October. So I feel good about how we're positioned now. The airfreight is not related to the iPhone. So these are unrelated topics, but generally speaking, the airfreight is planned to get enough units into the channel in time for the holidays and is necessary for that reason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, is that air freight non &#x2013; I would imagine that you had that typically in most Q4s, and accordingly, is that larger than usual for this quarter because your demand perception may have changed over the last 30 or 60 days, or is that just a normal sequential seasonal headwind to margins that you always experienced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more than normal. And so you're correct that in general, we spend more on freight in Q1. However, this increase is larger than usual. I'm sorry I can't be specific on the product, but it's a abnormal sequential increase.</p>

          <p>To the Mac, we have a little less than 13,000 worldwide and our focus in terms of expansion in the indirect channel is much more so in the international areas &#x2013; in international markets. As you probably could tell from our results, we grew the Mac much stronger outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. and I'm sure part of that is just the economic difference between the two, but the international business particularly in Europe and in Asia was extremely strong last quarter.</p>

France was 39%, and so you had Western Europe less the UK extremely strong, a tremendous multiple from market growth, and even countries, Switzerland and Italy were in the mid-30s and so several European countries of, you know, sizeable countries were incredibly strong.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just on the CapEx, there's about 4.7% of your sales, and I'm just trying to understand, I know you have the new stores in there, but aside from that, you talked about normal replacement of existing capital assets, manufacturing-related equipment. Any more details you can provide on that piece of the CapEx that's being spent on the capital assets and, in particular, what that is and when that should start to decrease as a percentage of sales?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure I look at it as a percent of sales, but in fiscal '09, our CapEx was about 1.150 billion, up from about 1.1 billion last year. We spent a little under 400 million in both years on Retail Stores. As I look forward, we're going to continue to confidently open Retail Stores and keep them fresh and exciting from a remodel perspective. The other parts of our business, we are spending capital on the facilities, infrastructure and in the manufacturing space as well. But at 1.1 billion in the last two years, we've not been terribly capital intensive.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The things that we're considering &#x2013; we don't give Mac specific forecasts as you know or product-specific forecasts, but the things I think you should consider that we considered anyway in coming up with our numbers. The September quarter was benefited by a 50,000-unit order from the State of Maine. This completed the 70,000-unit order; the other 20,000 had shipped in our fiscal Q3. It also benefited from an extremely strong back-to-school season, and we had an extremely strong promotion wrapped around that as you're aware.</p>
          <p>We also had Snow Leopard, and it's with every new OS, you have some pent-up demand that shifts with the operating system as people hold to get the latest software. And finally, and I wouldn't underestimate this, the demand for the portable that we announced in June was a key for the quarter at 35% growth. And some of that was demand that was probably &#x2013; probably existed in June, but we were unable to fill. So it got the quarter off to a very good start. So those are the things that we thought about as we forecasted the Mac business.</p>

          <p>To be specific, we already shipped the iPhone 3G in over 80 today. We ship the 3GS in 64 countries as of the end of last quarter, and we would forecast that we would be in over 80 by the end of the calendar year with the 3GS.</p>

          <p>Last question relates to guidance. Given the accounting change, in my opinion, GAAP accounting loses some meaning. Can you provide a range of pro-forma expectations for December? I think that would be more meaningful to the investment community.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I provided you the guidance that we provided. It's very detailed. And consistent with when we began to ship the iPhone, we provide guidance on GAAP, and we will report to you our numbers in January for the December order.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, yeah, thanks. I have a question on, I guess, the enterprise business. Two questions. First, on your iPhone business, any color you can share with us, the breakout between consumer and enterprise?</p>
          <p>At least qualitatively and, then, how that's been trending, and then the second question is, one of the key features with Snow Leopard is native support for Exchange. Any comment on how that's helping your enterprise effort? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shaw, it's Tim. In terms of the iPhone in the corporate market, what I can tell you is that employee demand for iPhone in the corporate environment is very strong. Since the launch of the iPhone 3GS, which coupled with the software made a number of improvements that CIOs were looking for. The iPhone is either being deployed or being piloted in well over 50% of the Fortune 100, and from an international point of view, if you look at Europe, this is true in about 50% of the Financial Times 100, and so we feel very good with the progress that we've made since the iPhone 3GS was announced.</p>
          <p>Also another very key market for us that some people call enterprise, is that over 350 higher ed institutions have approved iPhone for their faculty, staff and students, and in addition to both of these, we continue to be very happy with our sales in the government arena. In terms of Snow Leopard and Exchange, I don't have any statistics to go over with you yet. It's very early. As you know, we just started shipping at the end of August last quarter and so we'll see how that does, but it clearly makes it very simple for the Windows user to with Exchange working right out of the box.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Nice quarter. I guess a question with regards to the enterprise as well. I think last quarter you may have commented, you know, there's several government agencies out there that have 30,000 plus iPhone units installed. I was wondering if we could get an update there on maybe granular specifics on some of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No new update on specific numbers, but we continue to be very pleased with the market and the number of agencies that are adopting the iPhone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and the same with regards to corporate entities as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I just went through that in the previous call, but to repeat it, well over 50% of the Fortune 100 are deploying or piloting the iPhone, and this strength is also happening internationally and if you take Europe or about 50% of the Financial Times 100 are deploying or actively evaluating iPhone for a broad deployment and so these numbers are very impressive to us, and we feel like we're making great progress in this market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely. And Tim, I think that you commented in the past that three of that Fortune 100 had 25,000 units or greater, any update by there by chance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>None that we can provide. As you can probably guess, many of these companies would like to keep their specific numbers confidential.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood, thanks. And, final question. Any chance that the international activations grew on a year-over-year basis for the iPhone? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, iPhone sell-through was up 38% year over year. As Peter went through in the preamble last year and I think it's very important to remember, we expanded channel inventory by about two million units because it was the launch of the iPhone 3G during that quarter. We only grew inventory this particular year by less than 600,000 and so that sell-through increase of 38% compares to a projected rate of market growth of 5% from Canalys, and so it's a significant multiple-to-market growth based on the market statistics that we have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that 5% just to clarify is international?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quick question for you on the Macintosh side if I could to do a deeper dive in the education sector? And a question for Tim, you guys have been pretty cautious regarding state spending here given the tax issues that you've quoted for the different states. So what powered the upside in education, specifically K-12 and higher Ed?</p>
          <p>And also, if you can give additional color on what happened in the student buy versus your expectation as well given the popularity of notebooks for students? And I had one follow-up if I could?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one first. The student buy, you can see those numbers trickling through our retail results and you can't see this because we don't break it out separately but they significantly helped our on-line results and the institutions that buy through bookstores and so the back-to-school season, again, was our strongest ever and I would attribute a great piece of that to the individual business that you are talking about.</p>
          <p>In terms of the institutional business, I have been worried about state spending. I'm still worried about state spending. We saw no material stimulus funding flowing last quarter. We saw a little but it was a very small number. We may see more this quarter but it's too early to tell. In terms of the institutional increase, the institutions grew about 12% and that increase was the big thing that pushed us over the zero mark there was the State of Maine order, and so it was extremely key in the education institution achievement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then on Mac inventory, just doing a deeper dive here on the airfreight question. I know you won't talk about the product, but what's driving the increase in airfreight? Is it the timing of new announcement? Are you having issues with component availability? Are you running into manufacturing yield issues? Why the uptick here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what's driving the airfreight is that I haven't been able to figure out a way to move the holiday season. And so we have to get all of these units into the channel for the holiday sales and sorry I can't be more specific than that.</p>
