          <p>Good day, and welcome to this Apple Computer Fourth Quarter Financial</p>
          <p>Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer, and he'll be joined by Apple COO, Tim Cook, and Apple Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&amp;A session with the analysts. Today we are releasing preliminary results of Apple's fourth fiscal quarter. As our press release indicates, these results may be subject to significant adjustment due to the likely restatement of historical results that we have previously disclosed. Though preliminary, we are providing this information today as we believe it is in investors' best interests that we present current results and the related trends of the business.</p>
          <p>Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, future products, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and the likely restatement of historical financial results pending the determination of appropriate accounting treatment for Apple's historical stock option granting practices. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2005, the Form 10-Q for the first and second fiscal quarters of 2006, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report very strong preliminary results for the fourth quarter, and the best Mac shipments by far in any quarter in Apple's history. The quarter's revenue was 4.84 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth. The strong revenue was fueled by robust sales of our Mac Portable products, a successful back-to-school season and the continued popularity of our music products. Preliminary operating margin for the quarter was 12.6%, and preliminary net income was 546 million, or $0.62 per diluted share on a GAAP basis.</p>
          <p>I would like to talk first about our Mac products, which represented 58% of our total quarterly revenue. We shipped a total of 1.61 million Macs, significantly greater than the previous quarterly record of 1.38 million Macs sold in the first quarter of Apple's fiscal 2000.</p>
          <p>Our September quarter Mac shipments grew 30% over the prior year, which is more than three times IDC's latest published market growth projections for the quarter. We believe this growth rate is particularly remarkable given the tough comparison to the prior year's September quarter, which was up 48% year-over-year. The strong growth in Mac sales was largely due to unprecedented demand for our Portable products, with sales of nearly 1 million units, representing 61% of all Macs sold during the quarter. Ending channel inventory of Macs was below our target range of four to five weeks.</p>
          <p>With our Mac Pro launch in August, we have transitioned all of our Macs to the Intel architecture in nine months. We're extremely pleased with our team's speed and skill in executing this complex transition, and our developers continue to make great progress as well. There are over 4,000 universal applications available today, and we estimate that by the end of December, 80% of the 500 Mac applications we consider most important to our customers will be available in universal versions.</p>
          <p>Our music products generated another quarter of strong results, representing 42% of total Company revenue and increasing 36% year-over-year. iPod shipments grew 35% year-over-year to 8.73 million, bolstered by the announcement of our new iPods on September 12th and our very popular back-to-school promotion. Reviews of the new iPods have been positive, and we're confident in our new lineup, despite increased competition this holiday season. Channel inventory of iPods as of the end of the quarter was within our target range of four to six weeks on a look-back basis.</p>
          <p>The iTunes Store continues to be the world's leading online music store, and now offers movies in addition to over 3.5 million songs, 220 television programs, 9,000 music videos, and 20,000 audio books. Based on the latest data available from Nielsen SoundScan, iTunes accounts for 85% of songs purchased and downloaded in the US. The iPod ecosystem continues to thrive, with over 3,000 accessory products currently available. We estimate that over 70% of the 2007 model year cars sold in the US will offer direct iPod integration as an option.</p>
          <p>The Apple retail stores posted very strong results. Revenue for the quarter was 936 million, up 41% year-over-year, and segment operating profit was 50 million. For the full year, revenue from the stores increased by over 1 billion, and average revenue per store grew to almost 24 million. We opened ten new stores during the September quarter, ending with 165. With an average of 158 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was 5.9 million. The stores sold a record 323,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 60% year-over-year growth.</p>
          <p>Based on our latest survey, over 50% of the customers buying Macs in our stores were new to the Mac. Applying that rate to the quarter's results, we estimate that the average store added about a thousand new Mac customers during the quarter. Over 20 million people visited the stores during the quarter, and customers attended over 125,000 personal training sessions.</p>
          <p>Our Education channel had an outstanding quarter, selling a record number of Macs, driving 20% year-over-year growth. We are particularly pleased with this growth, which is significantly greater than IBC's most recently published forecast for the US education market for the quarter. It was the most successful back-to-school quarter ever for our higher ed business, where shipments of Mac Portables increased 49% year-over-year. This result was due in large part to the popularity of the MacBook in higher ed, as well as our very successful back-to-school promotion.</p>
          <p>In terms of geographic results, including sales from our retail stores, quarterly revenue in the Americas, Europe and Japan was up 33%, 27% and 26% respectively.</p>
          <p>Preliminary gross margin was 29.2% on a GAAP basis, about 80 basis points higher than our guidance primarily due to product mix. Included in GAAP cost of goods sold was 5 million of stock-based compensation expense. Preliminary GAAP operating expenses were 803 million, including 34 million in expense related to stock-based compensation. OpEx was about 17 million higher than guidance, primarily due to higher than expected revenue. OI&amp;E was 113 million, about 13 million higher than guidance largely due to higher than expected cash balances and higher than expected yields on cash investments.</p>
          <p>The tax rate for the quarter was about 24%, below our guidance of 32% due to a one-time credit resulting from the settlement of prior year tax audits in the United States and proportionately higher than anticipated operating income from foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We had a very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by 934 million to end with over 10.1 billion. This was primarily a function of strong earnings and working capital management.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which excludes the impact of any restatement and includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. For the quarter, we are targeting revenue between 6 billion and 6.2 billion. We expect total quarterly costs of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately 45 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to be about 28.25%, reflecting approximately 6 million related to stock-based compensation expense.</p>
          <p>We expect GAAP OpEx to be about 905 million to 920 million, including about 39 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&amp;E be about 120 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%. We expect to generate GAAP EPS of about 0.70 to $0.73, including an anticipated $0.03 per share related to non-cash share-based compensation expense.</p>
          <p>In closing, we are very proud of our accomplishments at the company in fiscal 2006. We sold over 5.3 million Macs, representing our best year ever, and we reached new heights with iPod shipments, selling more than 39 million. We generated 19.3 billion in revenue, representing 39% year-over-year growth, and we've added 11 billion in top line growth in the last two years. We skillfully executed an incredibly complex architecture transition, converting our entire Mac line to Intel microprocessors in nine months. We remain committed to innovation and we are very enthusiastic about our product pipeline.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like the open the call to questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And we will take over first question from David Bailey from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much. Two short questions, please. Can you help us understand the impact that the lower price points associated with the new iPods are going to have on your blended ASP and gross margin for the December quarter? And then just a follow-up, the component environment has been very favorable the past few quarters; can you give us your outlook on the remainder of the year for the component prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I'll start with the iPod questions, and Tim can discuss the component environment. As a result of the price reductions that we took on September 12 and the introduction of the new $79 shuffle, we believe that our ASPs in iPods will be down in the December quarter from what they were in September. But we are very excited about the line that we just announced, looking forward to the holiday season, and confident.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, in the notebook hard drive area, we expect that since supply exceeds demand in this area, that there would be favorable pricing. For DRAMs, NAND Flash and LCD panels, demand temporarily exceeds supply due to the usual seasonal demand. And we expect other commodities to decline consistent with historical trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. Could we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>That will come from Richard Gardner from Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I had two questions. One, I was hoping, Peter, you could give us the typical walkthrough on the pluses and minuses for gross margin in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, was hoping that you could give us a status update on your retail pilots with incremental retail customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Richard, as I said in my prepared remarks, the gross margin declined by about 110 basis points in the September quarter from the June quarter, which was actually less than what we had guided down; we had guided down closer to 200 basis points. And the reason for this difference was primarily a better mix of higher margin products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Peter, would you &#x2013; could you give us the same walkthrough for the December quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the December quarter? Sure. Guiding margin down about a point as a result of the quarter having much higher iPod and other music product sales, and also having a full quarter of the lower iPod pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, in terms of expanding distribution on the Macintosh, as you know, we've had a pilot going at Best Buy in seven stores. We've just concluded this week to expand that during this quarter to over 50. The stores are located around the country, and they will be selling both desktops and notebooks as well as some Mac software and accessories. And we'll continue to evaluate how the program is going over the next several months to conclude what the next step should be. We're also running a small pilot with Circuit City that we have really just started, and there's no data available. But we will obviously monitor that and conclude what to do with that in future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>That will come from Ben Reitzes from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, thanks. Hey, so Steve says in this release that 2007 will be one of the most exciting product years in the history of Apple. Does that mean we should all show up for Macworld? What does that mean versus 2006? Any other comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, as you know, we don't comment on our product road map in terms of specifics, but we are very confident of what we have in the pipeline and very excited that our customers will be pleased with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess with regard to a couple things &#x2013; other things -- with regard to other music, that line was a little below expectations, while virtually every other line was much better than expected. Is there something going on with download habits, Peter or Tim, and can you elaborate there? And should that line pick up with the addition of movies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, in the quarter, it was relatively flat sequentially, but up over 70% year-over-year. In the quarter, we reduced our channel inventory on the Apple-branded iPod accessories in advance of our announcements on September 12, so that played into it. And also, the summer is usually not the best quarter for music sales. People are on vacation, and it generally is not the strongest quarter for new album releases, either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you would expect that to pick up quite a bit into the holidays, normal seasonality? Nothing special to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, not providing a quantitative forecast, but yes, qualitatively, and seasonally, and with album releases, we have seen that in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly, inventory and receivables went up. Could you just talk about, was that in line with your expectations? It looked like channel inventory is okay, but what about those two lines? Are you preparing &#x2013; what are you preparing for on the inventory line, and &#x2013; or what does it say about the linearity of the quarter on the A/R side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of inventory, it was up about 100 million year-over-year. We've opened 41 stores this year. Virtually all of the increase in inventory is in the retail stores to serve customers. As relates to accounts receivable, they were up a little over 350 million, but as I said in my prepared remarks, in the last two years we've added 11 billion in top line growth. The DSO performance was very strong in the quarter at 24 days.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So the inventory was due to increased stores and getting ready for the holidays?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>That'll be Andrew Neff from Bear Stearns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure -- two things. Just as a point of clarification: Japan, the CPU units were down. Could you just sort of give us a background of what was going on in Japan? And second, there have been &#x2013; maybe you could just &#x2013; to the extent you can talk about it, just with the ongoing investigation, could you give us some sense about the role that you've clarified, and that Steve Jobs may have in this options investigation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Andy, I will start. As we reported about two weeks ago in our release, the Special Committee of Apple's Board, with its independent advisers, reported their key findings, one of which was that the investigation found no misconduct by any member of Apple's current management team, and that includes Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, on the Japan side, when you combine the channel results with our retail store results, Macintosh units, on a year-over-year basis, declined by 10%. The market in Japan is among the weakest in the world, and IDC was also expecting a contraction during the quarter. However, having said that, we're not pleased with our performance there, and we've got a number of activities underway to attempt to improve them. I would point out that despite the reduction in the Macintosh area, that from a year-over-year point of view, revenue was up 26% in Japan on strong iPod sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that's what I was trying to understand, because the CPU units were down but the revenues were up strongly. So I just was trying to clarify that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and that's due to strong iPod sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tim. Thanks very much. Thanks, Pete.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, great, thanks. Can you guys give us an update on the progress you're seeing in the international markets with the iPod, as you did last quarter? And then, on the iTunes side, do the video sales still have similar economics to the music sales, as you have said in the past, or is this changing as you scale the video business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, we don't report individual product gross margins, but we're running the music store at above breakeven levels. Our view continues to be that selling music and TV shows, and now movies, helps us to sell iPod and accessories. And as it relates to international iPod results, we continue to be happy with our progress. In the UK, Canada, Japan and Australia, our market share ranges from 40 to 50%, and in many Western European countries, we've picked up market share year-over-year, typically six to seven points in places like France and Germany and Italy and Spain.</p>

          <p>We did drop below the four to five weeks, as Peter said in his opening remarks. That was due primarily to very, very strong demand on the MacBook and a great reception to the iMac that we announced in early September -- the new lineup of iMacs. I do anticipate being able to get the channel back to reasonable levels during the quarter, but I'm not forecasting what will happen at the end of the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Guys, can you characterize the demand for the new nano launch? I guess in the context of last year, Tim, I think remember you saying that last year you found the demand staggering and you could only get about a million units out the door in the final three, four weeks of September. How did the rollout go this year relative to last?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The customer reception was excellent. The analyst reviews have been very, very favorable. If you look at the quarter and the months, iPod demand really accelerated significantly post the launch, and it was that acceleration that allowed us to exceed our expectations for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess switching gears to the desktop, growth was about 4% year-on-year on a unit basis, and probably not that surprising, given the cannibalization trends we're seeing in the overall market, but as you look at that business going forward, is that a reasonable growth rate that you should be looking for, or can it improve with new product introductions and things like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't forecast the portable and desktop area, but as you mentioned, there is a widespread movement to portables, and our portables grew 56% year-over-year and so we're incredibly pleased with what is a blowout in that quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thank you very much. A couple quick questions. One is Peter, could you give a little bit of a sense on direct/indirect trends? Specifically, you guys highlighted last quarter the focus on improving the international penetration and I was wondering if you are in fact seeing a significant increase in the indirect percentage of the iPod? And then also if you could make some directional comments on the PC side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Harry, our direct percent in Q4 of the September quarter was 54% in total, and that was up from 50% in the June quarter and the year-ago quarter was 52%. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, our Americas and Europe and Japan revenues were up reasonably closely and I would say that we're very happy with both the performance of our indirect channel and our growth overseas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the change you're seeing, Peter, is that similar then within product categories as well as the iPods versus the PCs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x2013; as you know, the iPod has a much broader distribution. It's a little less than 40,000 points around the world, direct and indirect. And Mac distribution is a little over 7,000 points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you guys have made significant improvements in the bill of materials on the iPod. Would it be fair to say that the iPods have now achieved similar gross margins as the PC product line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to comment quite that specifically. I will say that the iPod gross margin was above 20% in the September quarter, but the gross margin was down a bit from the June quarter as a result of the price reductions that we took in September in our transition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question is you mentioned traffic in the stores at greater than 20 million. Can you be a bit more specific on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a bit above 20 million. The performance in the stores was just outstanding. The revenue was 934 million. We were up year-over-year, 41%. Mac sales were up 60%. Our new-to-Mac for Mac sales actually went over 50% this quarter. And that's just &#x2013; it's amazing, given that we've sold 323,000 Macs in the quarter, that's a little more than half for the people who had never owned a Mac before. We were thrilled by that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. The 1.5 or 1.6 million Mac number obviously is impressive and as you look at that number, is there any way for us to think about what potentially could be pent-up demand in that number versus, I guess kind of the pure demand? I guess it's a difficult question, but how do you think about that kind of tradeoff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gene, I think the Mac results were a combination of us completing the Intel transition. The exceptional customer response to the innovative products that included those that were transitioned, and very, very strong back-to-school and education sales including two large K-12 deals that totaled 50,000 units during the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess just as you look at the December quarter, can you remind us &#x2013; last year, I know that the iMac was pretty successful in the December quarter. Does that kind of baton get shifted for the holiday quarter to the iMac from the notebooks? Is that one way to look at it, or is there any differentiation there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple questions. One, can you give us any color on Boot Camp downloads? And what are your surveys saying in terms of people are coming in, I think you said over 50% in the stores are switchers, are they looking at running OS X or Windows or just what you are hearing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Boot Camp, Shannon, we're now over 1 million downloads, which we are very, very pleased with. And we continue to have a plan to integrate Boot Camp and Leopard next spring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the performance in the stores, again, this quarter we went over 50% new-to-Mac and I think customers are coming in looking at Macs based upon just our great hardware, the stability of OS 10, the great iLife software, and frankly, the great experience that they're having in the stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just, can you give any metrics in terms of iTunes Store, games were just launched, videos, just what kind of take rates? I think at one point I heard a goal of a million, or maybe that was during the launch, a million videos, or movies per week, by the end of the year. Is that still a goal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll tell you, we will likely re-release game and movie sales at a future date so I don't want to comment specifically, but we are very happy with the performance of the iTunes Store with everything that it's selling and as I said, we think it's a big reason why people are buying iPods and accessories and certainly think it's helping us in the Mac business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and Peter, just a clarification on tax rate, you said 32% going forward, but are any of the foreign tax benefits in terms of the mix shift of revenue ongoing, in which case maybe we'll see a lower tax rate?</p>

          <p>Thank you. A lot of it's been asked already, but I do have a couple. I understand you don't want to give specific gross margin numbers by product, but maybe in the same spirit as what you said kind of qualitatively and directionally about the iPod gross margins, are you able to give a similar color on the Mac gross margin in the September quarter, how that changed sequentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to be that specific. The Mac margins, we are quite happy within the September quarter and that was one of the reasons why our gross margin exceeded the guidance that we gave and part of the product mix that we saw.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And another one, this is a little off the beaten path but I just wonder what you think of Google's purchase of YouTube and kind of, as you think longer term about the evolution of the video distribution market, kind of outside the mainstream content providers, how do you think the landscape is changing and does any of that affect your business? What do you think of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I'll let the people at Google comment on YouTube, but we continue to believe that video will be big in the portable space, not only in PCs but in iPods and we certainly look forward to participating in that going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just lastly, on the Mac Pro uptake, any color on customer reception for that upgrade, and to what extent is demand still pent up as we are waiting for key applications like Creative Suite, et cetera to become universal before we see better shipments for that product?</p>

          <p>Both customer and analyst reaction has been very, very positive on the Mac Pro announcement that we made in August. We are still seeing a &#x2013; what we believe is a delay in purchasing that we think primarily is associated with applications, in particular the Creative Suite.</p>

And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've got a little under 40,000 points of sale for the iPod around the world.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>No, total iPod sales were up in total, but on a per store basis they were down a little bit as a result of the increase in the channel distribution.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment at all on the &#x2013; any iPod or marketing promotions you're doing in international markets right now that are different from what we're seeing in the US? If there's anything special going on to try and drive demand in some of the international markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We have some work that we're doing with Coke in Europe, specifically in the UK and Germany. They are going to put a specific website out that is linked directly into iTunes and they will be giving away 70 million free songs over the next month or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then can you &#x2013; is there any updates on any of the iTunes stores launching in international markets? It seems like in a number of countries, like Japan, the iPod sales really preceded the iTunes stores for whatever reason. Any updates you can give on iTunes as it progresses in international markets, movie downloads in international markets, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we today have the iTunes music store in 21 countries, which is covering close to 90% of where music is legally purchased. We look forward to bringing movies international in 2007.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. A lot of questions have been asked. Just one quick one on iTV, any feedback &#x2013; initial feedback you can provide us on that product? And second, any comment on what type of units this product could be? Is it a couple hundred thousand units, or is it a multimillion type unit type of product? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, we announced that product before shipping it to give customers a total view of the solution that we were bringing to market as we announced the downloading of movies.

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Hey Peter, I seem to recall that last year in the December quarter you had an extra week and I was wondering if you could give us any additional metrics in terms of how that may have affected iPod or Mac units, just help us to get our arms around forecasting that for this upcoming quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Last year, it was a 14 week quarter for us as we realign our calendar every six or seven years. The iPod shipments in the year-ago quarter was certainly benefited by that 14th week, which fell between Christmas and New Year's, and as we told you last January, we increased our channel inventories in the December quarter by about 550,000 units. So thinking through iPods, you should account for the 14th week and an increase in inventory, and if you're thinking through Mac sales, certainly contemplate a 14th week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That will come from Bill Fearnley from FTN Midwest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, two questions on the guidance. When you look at the economic environment and the consumer in particular, could you give us a view of what you're seeing there as we approach the holiday season? And then how does that affect guidance? And then I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Gary will take your first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well again, this would probably be generally speaking, it's from a macro point of view, but the economy is slowing because the Fed has hiked 17 times over the last two or three years. But what most of us are hearing from the economists out there is that the economy is headed for a soft landing, and that the consumer appears resilient in that, especially as energy prices have eased. So we tend to agree with this outlook barring any surprises.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then when you look at availability for the upcoming quarter, you come into the quarter being &#x2013; having some, having channel inventory that's below expectations. Do you expect being below target inventory here for Macintoshes for a good chunk of the fourth quarter, or do you expect to see some recovery in the beginning of the quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, channel inventory is a function of both supply and demand. And we've factored our thinking on both of those into our guidance that Peter has already laid out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think you'll have to air freight anything in, or do you think that the recovery is going to be manageable here, or do you really have to hustle to get stuff in here into the States to catch up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We typically air freight Portables and we would continue to do that this quarter. Last quarter we also air freighted iMacs because of their popularity in September and we would continue to do so for a portion of those in the current quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one last question on iTunes, if I could. Could you give any more color on profitability of movies versus music? Any update on that since you're getting further down the road here with videos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know Bill, we don't give products' specific gross margins, so I can't, again our philosophy is to run the Store a little bit over breakeven.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Peter, I was hoping you could provide some thoughts with regards to your ability to attract additional major studio content into the feature film category for iTunes? And if there is hesitation or hurdles, what are you facing there? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, last October we announced TV shows with just five programs and within a year have over 220 today from over 40 networks. We've just launched movie downloads with one studio, or company, and have 75 titles and we plan to add more over time.</p>

      <speaker id="26" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't, but I would be happy to. Our CapEx in the quarter was 134 million and the retail portion of that was 50 million.</p>

      <speaker id="26" type="q">

      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my call. Peter, with do you see as the key levers that could provide upside or downside to your gross margin forecast for this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll make a few comments and Tim can chime in. Certainly the level of sales and the mix within the products would be big levers, and direct versus indirect sales would be another lever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, commodity costs are another one, although I believe we have a reasonable handle on those and so I think the greatest ones are the top line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And lastly, did you see an uptick in either iMac or iPod following the September price moves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; post to the launch in iPod, we saw an acceleration of demand and it was that acceleration that allowed us to exceed our expectations in iPods for the quarter. The upfront of the new iMac lineup in early September was extremely well received and we air freighted units to market in order to cut transit times and get them to our customers as quickly as we could. And it was partly the iMac that led to a stalling below the four to five week target on the channel inventory.</p>
